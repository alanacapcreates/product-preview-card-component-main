### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources
- [CSS Grid Layout - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This was an overview on CSS Grid so I can try to understand the properties used.
- [CSS Grid Layout Tool](https://grid.layoutit.com/) - This helped me visualize how to create a CSS Grid. I really liked this, and will use it going forward to help understand Grid.
- [Preventing a Grid Blowout](https://css-tricks.com/preventing-a-grid-blowout/) - This is an amazing article which helped me debug why my image was overflowing my top row.
